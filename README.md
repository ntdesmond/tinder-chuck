# Tinder Chuck!

Tinder, but the only candidate is Chuck Norris.

## Description

***Tinder Chuck!*** is a [flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) app with jokes fetched from [chuck-api](https://github.com/chucknorris-io/chuck-api), displayed as swipeable cards, much like profiles in Tinder.

## Features

- **Swipeable cards** (no "New joke" button, sorry if you are unable to swipe)
- Jokes can be **opened in a browser** (at <https://api.chucknorris.io/>)
- Joke text can be copied right away
- Joke text is scrollable if it does not fit fully on the card
- Joke cards have a drawing of Chuck Norris from <https://github.com/chucknorris-io/>
  - Picture background color is randomized
